Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong announced at Budget 2022 that each Singaporean household will receive $200 in Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers in 2023 and 2024 as part of the $6.6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporeans cushion the impact of the Good & Services Tax (GST) increase.Â 

In addition, DPM also announced that every Singaporean household will get an additional S$100 CDC vouchers in January 2023 as part of the new $1.5 billion support package announced on 14 October 2022. This is on top of the S$200 CDC voucher announced at Budget 2022.

In January 2023, every Singaporean household can claim $300 in CDC Vouchers. The value of the vouchers will be allocated equally (i.e., $150 each) to be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, or at participating supermarkets. Singaporean Households have until 31 December 2023 to claim and spend their CDC Vouchers 2023.
