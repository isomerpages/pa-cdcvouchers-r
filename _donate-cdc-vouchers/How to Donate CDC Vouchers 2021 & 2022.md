The CDCs are now offering Singaporean households more flexibility in using CDC Vouchers through a donation option.  This is based on public feedback that some Singapore households would like to share the balance amount of their vouchers with those who might need it more amidst concern over rising cost of living.  

From now until 31 January 2023, Singaporean households may pledge the balance amount of their CDC Vouchers 2021 and 2022.  The CDC vouchers would be donated in cash value instead of vouchers, and donors would be eligible for tax deduction which will be reflected in the Year of Assessment 2024.

You may donate your household’s CDC Vouchers in three steps:<br><br>
a)	**View list of charities** – view the list of participating charities [here](/donate/charities/)<br>
b)	**Select preferred charity** – search by sectors* or names of charity using the search bar and click on their name where you will be directed to a FormSG<br>
c)	**Pledge your donation** – Login via Singpass to pledge the entire balance of the household’s CDC Vouchers (2021 and 2022) as of 31 December 2022 to the selected charity. Donors may opt to receive an email confirmation of their declaration.
